# Button

## Displays a button

Use a button for attributing actions or content to specific users. The user's name should _always_ be present when using Avatar â€“ either printed beside the avatar or in a tooltip.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="standard">
    <Button
      text="Click Me"
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={Button} />

## Usage

Buttons are used to represent a person or an organization. By default the avatar shows an image and gracefully falls back to the first initial of the username. While hydrating the component you may find it useful to render a skeleton template to indicate that Avatar is awaiting data. Avatars can be grouped with the AvatarList component.
